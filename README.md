Project Summary: Java Swing Application with MySQL Database
This project demonstrates the development of a Java application using Maven for dependency management, Swing for the graphical user interface, and MySQL for database operations.
Key Components:

    Database: MySQL
        Stores application data
        Enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation
    Backend: Java with Maven
        Utilizes Maven for project management and dependencies
        Implements business logic and database interactions
        Includes DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for database operations
    Frontend: Java Swing
        Creates a user-friendly graphical interface
        Allows users to interact with the application and database

Project Structure:

    src/main/java: Contains Java source code
    src/main/resources: Stores configuration files
    pom.xml: Maven configuration file for dependencies

Key Features:

    CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database
    User interface for data input and display
    Connection management between Java application and MySQL database

Technologies Used:

    Java 17
    Maven
    MySQL
    Java Swing
    JDBC for database connectivity

This project serves as a practical example of integrating various technologies to create a functional desktop application with database capabilities. It can be a valuable reference for developers looking to understand how to combine Java, Swing, Maven, and MySQL in a single application.
